Is it getting better
   Fmaj7           G 
or do you feel the same
Am              D
Will it make it easier on you? 
        Fmaj7          G
Now you got someone to blame

         C         Am        Fmaj7               C
You say; One love; One life; When it's one need; in the night
    C                   Am
Its one love; we get to share it
   Fmaj7                   C
It leaves you baby; If you don't care for it
 
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
and you want me to go without

Well it's too late; tonight;
to drag the past out - into the light
We're one;   but we're not the same;   
we get to carry each other - carry each other - One
 
Have you come here for forgiveness? 
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?    
To the lepers in your head
 
Did I ask too much - more than a lot; 
you gave me nothing - now it's all I got
We're one; but we're not the same
well we hurt each other - then we do it again; you say

Love is a temple; Love a higher law; Love is a temple; Love the higher law
C                        G
You ask me to enter; but then you make me crawl
G                     F
And I can't be holding on, to what you got
Fmaj7                 C
When all you got is hurt
 
One love, one blood, one life; 
you got to do what you should
One life - with each other; 
Sisters - Brothers

One life; But we're not the same
we get to carry each other
Carry each other; one; one"

I'll wait for you

Through the storm, we reach the shore

I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give

Nothing left to lose

I wanna take shelter from the poison rain

We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do
The city's a flood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place

Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Selling postcards
Of the hanging
They're painting
The passports brown
The beauty parlor
Is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes
The blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied
To the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad
They're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady
And I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
Cinderella
She seems so easy
""It takes one to know one""
She smiles
And puts her hands
In her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo
He's moaning
""You Belong to Me I Believe""
And someone says
""You're in the wrong place
My friend
You better leave""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken
All her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan
He's dressing
He's getting ready
For the show
He's going
To the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
Now Ophelia
She's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her death
Is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes
Are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
Einstein
Disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend
A jealous monk
He looked
So immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off
Sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you
Would not think
To look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing
The electric violin
On Desolation Row
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge
Of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps
The cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play
On penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean
Your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street
They've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready
For the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him
With self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's
Shouting to skinny girls
""Get Outta Here
If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being
Punished for going
To Desolation Row""
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see
That nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
Yes,
I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row"

Let her pale light in to fill up your room

You've been running away, from what you don't understand (Look)
She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there, when you hit the ground

She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment

I come back to the place you are

Without a noise, without my pride

The light, the heat

I see the doorway to a thousand churches

The resolution of all the fruitless searches

So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away

She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Don't stand so close to me

You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Don't stand so close to me

To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staff room
